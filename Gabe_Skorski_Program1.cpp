	cout << "Name: Gabe Skorski" << endl << endl;

	cout << "Prior Computer Science coursework:" << endl << "	- CSC 110" << endl 
		 << "	- CSC 120" << endl << "	- CSC 205" << endl << endl;

	cout << "Other experience with a computer: I use my computer for a lot of things"
		 << " such as " << endl 
		 << "photo editing, some video editing, making music, gaming, etc." << endl 
		 << endl;

	cout << "Tools: I have a Macbook Pro that is dual-booted with Windows 10 and OS X."
		 <<	" I am trying out " << endl 
		 << "Visual Studio but may switch because I am more familiar with Eclipse." 
		 << endl << endl;

	cout << "Past programming languages:" << endl << "	- Java" << endl 
		 << "	- Processing" << endl << "	- Max" << endl << endl;

	cout << "Personal goal for the course: To get beter at programming overall and"
		 << " learn " << endl 
		 << "how to pick up and interpret new languages quickly so I can adapt it to " 
		 << endl 
		 << "new languages in the future." << endl << endl;

	cout << "Concerns about the course: I have not gotten the optional textbook yet"
		 <<" but I think it will " << endl 
		 << "be helpful as my last CS class didn't have a text and it made things "
		 << "difficult." << endl << endl;
	
	cout << "Other courses currently:" << endl << "	- MAT 240 (Calculus III)" << endl 
		 << "	- PHY 121 (University Physics)" << endl << endl;
	
	cout << "A program that I have written that I liked the best was a simple 2 human"
		 << " player (no AI) " << endl 
		 << "tic tac toe game that was written in Java, played in the output window, "
		 << "for my CSC 110 class." << endl << endl;
	
	cout << "Lastly, something other than Computer Science that I like is music and " 
		 << endl 
		 << "playing the drums. I used to play in a local metal band many moons ago."
